# K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) Classification Project

This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm from scratch and demonstrates its usage for classification tasks. The project follows a modular structure for easy understanding and maintenance.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- `src/`: Core modules of the project, including the implementation of K-NN, data processing, evaluation, and visualization.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for the implemented modules.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required for the project.
- `main.py`: Main entry point to run the project.

## How to Run

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
